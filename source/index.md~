# Introduction

<aside class="notice">
Welcome to the TridentSDK Documentation site.
</aside>

TridentSDK is a team composed of absolute best Java developers from the Bukkit API. Trident is a completely cleanroom reimplmentation of the Minecraft server, which will improve server performance, flexibility, and simplicity. 

TridentSDK is the successor to the Bukkit/Spigot projects. Following the news of the "takeover" of the Bukkit project and the DMCA takedown of Bukkit, and therefore Spigot (we are quite aware of binary patches), we realized that someone needs to step up and create the best of server software for Minecraft after the decline of both projects. The result was TridentSDK, the development kit that is implemented by the server, Trident.

# Features

Feature | Explanation | Other servers
------- | ----------- | -------------
Developers | We are top-of-the-line developers from the Bukkit API | &#x2717;
Community | We are active community members and have high-profile connections to other developers | &#x2717;
Cleanroom | Legally stable, performance-oriented, controlled, simple | &#x2717;
Multithreaded | Effectively utilizes modern CPUs | &#x2717;
Tested | Published with results, all aspects and benchmarks + comparison included | &#x2717;
Pace | Development occurs nearly everyday | &#x2717;

# Installation

Because TridentSDK is currently a high-paced work in progress, and the reimplementation of the entire Minecraft server is time-taking, there are no builds availible to use. The server does not work at the moment. You will need to download the source and compile off of eachother.

## Prestiques

* [JDK 7](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/webnotes/install/) 
* [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Source download

> To download the server source, use:

```java
Not supported
```

```shell
git clone https://github.com/TridentSDK/Trident.git
```

> To download the API source, use:

```java
Not supported
```

```shell
git clone https://github.com/TridentSDK/TridentSDK.git
```

> To compile the final jar, use:

```java
Not supported
```

```shell
cd TridentSDK
mvn clean install

# Unix
mv target/tridentsdk-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar ..
# Windows
move target/tridentsdk-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar ..

cd ../Trident
javac -d .. -cp "../tridentsdk-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar" src/main/java/ src/main/java/net/tridentsdk/server/TridentStart.java
cd ..
```

After completing the above steps, you should be in the starting directory, with a fully compiled jar that can be run from the command line to start your server.
