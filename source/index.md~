# Introduction

<aside class="notice">
Welcome to the TridentSDK Documentation site.
</aside>

TridentSDK is a team composed of absolute best Java developers from the Bukkit API. Trident is a completely cleanroom reimplmentation of the Minecraft server, which will improve server performance, flexibility, and simplicity. 

TridentSDK is the successor to the Bukkit/Spigot projects. Following the news of the "takeover" of the Bukkit project and the DMCA takedown of Bukkit, and therefore Spigot (we are quite aware of binary patches), we realized that someone needs to step up and create the best of server software for Minecraft after the decline of both projects. The result was TridentSDK, the development kit that is implemented by the server, Trident.

# Features

Feature | Explanation | Other servers
------- | ----------- | -------------
Developers | We are top-of-the-line developers from the Bukkit API | &#x2717;
Community | We are active community members and have high-profile connections to other developers | &#x2717;
Cleanroom | Legally stable, performance-oriented, controlled, simple | &#x2717;
Multithreaded | Effectively utilizes modern CPUs | &#x2717;
Tested | Published with results, all aspects and benchmarks + comparison included | &#x2717;
Pace | Development occurs nearly everyday | &#x2717;

# Installation

Because TridentSDK is currently a high-paced work in progress, and the reimplementation of the entire Minecraft server is time-taking, there are no builds availible to use. The server does not work at the moment. You will need to download the source and compile off of eachother.

## Prestiques

To install Trident, you should have the following installed on your system:

* [JDK 7](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/webnotes/install/) 
* [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Source download

> To download the server source, use:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/TridentSDK/Trident.git
```

> To download the API source, use:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/TridentSDK/TridentSDK.git
```

> To compile the final jar, use:

```shell
cd TridentSDK
mvn clean install

# Unix
mv target/tridentsdk-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar ..
# Windows
move target/tridentsdk-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar ..

cd ../Trident
javac -d .. -cp "../tridentsdk-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar" src/main/java/ src/main/java/net/tridentsdk/server/TridentStart.java
cd ..
```

After completing the above steps, you should be in the starting directory, with a fully compiled jar that can be run from the command line to start your server.


## Troubleshooting

#### Command not found

TridentSDK is developed primarily on Unix (Ubuntu, Debian) systems. If you get this, look up an alternative to your command on your OS.

If your command starts with `git`, `mvn`, or `javac`, then you either need to install, or reinstall the tools in [Prestiques](#prestiques).

Another problem may be that you have not set your PATH environment variables yet. This is covered on the Presitques links.

#### Paths cannot be resolved

Just edit `..` to your primary directory where you executed your git commands at

#### Where is my jar file?

It's in the working directory of the command line. For Unix, this is often in your Home directory, and for Windows, this is in the user directory. Therefore, I recommend `cd`'ing to your desktop or other place where you know exactly where all the files are going to go and how they are organized.

## Updating

We are currently planning an update mechanism built into the server in the future. However, at the current moment, it has not been implemented. Open up your command line and execute the commands shown.

```shell
# Remove old files
rm -r Trident
rm -r TridentSDK

# Download again
git clone https://github.com/TridentSDK/Trident.git
git clone https://github.com/TridentSDK/TridentSDK.git
```

> Now go to [Source download](#source-download) and use the `To compile the final jar` steps.

# API

TridentSDK provides an excellent API for developing server modifications that can be used to modify game play that is determined by the server.

## Prestiques

* [A Java IDE](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Java_IDEs)
* [JDK 7](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/webnotes/install/) 
* [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads)
* Knowledge of the Java language

## Starting

As well as what is required in the prestiques, it is **imperative** that you know how to use Java and are familiar with it.
